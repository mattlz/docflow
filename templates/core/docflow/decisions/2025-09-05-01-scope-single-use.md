# ADR: Narrow MVP scope to a single flow

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The initial concept includes multiple workflows and broad capabilities. This increases complexity, time to first value, and risk of unfocused execution.

## Decision
Constrain the MVP to a single, end‑to‑end flow that demonstrates the core value proposition and can be measured against clear success criteria.

## Consequences
- Faster time to a measurable release
- Reduced architectural and operational complexity
- Clearer UX and acceptance criteria
- Defers multi‑flow orchestration and advanced integrations

## Alternatives Considered
- Support multiple flows in MVP
- Defer MVP and ship a more complete v1
