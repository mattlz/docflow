# Active Focus

- Current Feature: F000 â€“ Project scaffolding
- Status: Ready
- Next Steps:
  - Initialize repository with TypeScript (strict), lint, format, and testing
  - Create baseline app structure in `src/` with feature folders and absolute imports
  - Add a basic health route/page and CI for lint/test/build
  - Define environment variables and add `.env.example`
  - Document bootstrap and run instructions in README

Notes:
- Confirm local dev builds and tests pass before starting the next feature.
